Deep Learning-Based Image Steganography
🔒 Securely hide images within images using Deep Learning and CNNs



📌 Overview
This project implements an image steganography system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system allows hiding a secret image inside a cover image and later extracting it with minimal loss. Unlike traditional steganography methods, this approach leverages deep learning to achieve higher imperceptibility and robustness.



🚀 Features
1. Encode (Hide Image): Embed a secret image within a cover image.
2. Decode (Extract Image): Retrieve the hidden image from the stego image.
3. Deep Learning-based Approach: Utilizes a CNN model for efficient encoding and decoding.
4. Performance Evaluation: Measures PSNR, SSIM, payload capacity, and robustness.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Streamlit-based UI for easy interaction.



🖥️ Technologies Used
1. Python (Deep Learning & Image Processing)
2. TensorFlow / Keras (CNN Model Training)
3. OpenCV (Image Preprocessing)
4. Streamlit (Web Interface)
5. NumPy & Matplotlib (Data Processing & Visualization)



📊 Performance Metrics
1. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): Measures image quality after encoding.
2. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM): Evaluates how well the stego image retains visual similarity.
3. Payload Capacity: Determines how much information can be hidden.
4. Robustness: Checks resistance against noise and distortions.
